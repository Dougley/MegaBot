# MegaBot [![https://travis-ci.org/Dougley/MegaBot](https://img.shields.io/travis/Dougley/MegaBot.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/Dougley/MegaBot)
This repository holds the code for the bot used in the [Discord Feedback](https://discord.gg/discord-feedback) server.

## Installation
Please note that this is a highly specialized project, we won't guarantee compatibility with your environment/setup.    
That being said, at least Node.js v8 or higher is required due to the use of modern JavaScript. An example `.env` configuration file can be found in the project root, edit it accordingly and **save it as `.env`, not `.env.example`**

## Testing
```
npm test
```
